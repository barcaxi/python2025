# Python Exercise 5

# Lab #1

1. Open your Pycharm project `Python2025` from your main `python` folder.

1. Create a new weekly project folder called `Ex5` -  (<kbd>File</kbd> ... <kbd>New...</kbd> ... <kbd>Directory</kbd>):

## Part 1 - List Exercises

1.  In your `Ex5` folder create a Python program called `list1.py` to print each of the items in the `numbers` list below:

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    ```
    Expected output:
    ```
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5    
    ```

1.  Write a Python program called `list2.py` to print the total and average of the items in the `numbers` list:

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    ```
    Expected output:
    ```
    total = 15
    average = 3
    ```

1.  Write a Python program `list3.py` to find the maximum and minimum item in the `numbers` list:

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    ```
    Expected output:
    ```
    min = 1
    max = 5
    ```

1.  Write a Python program `list4.py` to sort items in the `numbers` list in ascending order:

    ```python
    numbers = [2, 3, 5, 1, 4]

    ```
    Expected output:
    ```
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    ```

1.  Write a Python program `list5.py` to sort items in the `numbers` list in descending order:

    ```python
    numbers = [2, 3, 5, 1, 4]

    ```
    Expected output:
    ```
    [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    ```

1.  Write a Python program `list6.py` to insert a new value at the start (0) and end (6) of the `numbers` list:

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    ```
    Expected output:
    ```
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
    ```

1.  Write a Python program `list7.py` to delete the items 1 and 3 from the `numbers` list:

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    ```
    Expected output:
    ```
    [2, 4, 5]
    ```

1.  Write a Python program `list8.py` to count the frequency of each item in the `numbers` list:

    ```python
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 5, 3]

    ```
    Expected output:
    ```
    1 occurs 2 time(s)
    2 occurs 1 time(s)
    3 occurs 3 time(s)
    4 occurs 1 time(s)
    5 occurs 2 time(s)
    ```
